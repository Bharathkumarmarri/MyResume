    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> With over 5 years of expertise in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), specializing in JAVA and J2EE technologies, I have applied Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban throughout project lifecycles. My extensive experience includes developing web applications using React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, and Node.js, as well as designing Single Page Applications with the MEAN stack. I possess hands-on proficiency in Java 8 technologies, including Lambda Expressions and Stream API, alongside a strong understanding of server-side rendering with React and server technologies like Node.js and Spring Boot. Additionally, I have expertise in container-based technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, Microservices architecture development using Spring Boot, and ETL pipelines utilizing Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, and Python. Furthermore, I have optimized SQL queries for enhanced database performance, configured application servers such as JBoss and Apache Tomcat, and designed CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes for automated software releases. I am also experienced in version control tools like CVS, SVN, Clear Case, and Git, and proficient in deploying Docker containers with AWS Code Pipeline in AWS ECS using services such as CloudFormation, Code Build, and Code Deploy, leveraging AWS cloud services including EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, VPC, and IAM.

            Involved extensively in various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), I have specialized in crafting user interfaces with React JS, Flux, and React router for Single Page Application (SPA) development, enhancing user experience and dynamism. Leveraging Java 1.8, Docker, and Spring Boot microservices deployed on AWS EC2, I constructed robust backend systems using Node.js and Express.js with a focus on MVC architecture for responsive and efficient web applications. Employing Microservice architecture with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka, I facilitated seamless data streaming and processing across distributed systems and platforms like Kubernetes and Docker. Additionally, I managed NoSQL databases such as MongoDB for CRUD operations and orchestrated Agile methodologies within JIRA for efficient task management. Engaged in code reviews, mentorship sessions, and version control using GIT and GITBash, I orchestrated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins for software deployment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security. Further, I designed AWS Lambda-based APIs and implemented IAM solutions using OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML, while monitoring application performance using AWS services like CloudWatch.

            Specializing in Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, I have actively participated in SDLC sessions to ensure timely delivery of high-quality products. Proficient in developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Angular 11, JavaScript, and NGRX, I've implemented route guards and resolver services for enhanced functionality. Additionally, I have contributed to open-source Python projects and online communities like PyPI and Stack Overflow. With expertise in application authentication using Spring Security and OAuth, I've utilized Java 1.8 features including streams and lambda expressions. My experience extends to SQL and PL/SQL applications, Spring Data JPA for ORM mapping, and Kafka cluster configuration for messaging infrastructure. Moreover, I've deployed Docker containers with Spring Boot microservices in Azure app services, monitored applications using Splunk, and collaborated effectively with distributed teams using Slack, Jira, and Confluence.

            Proficient in Angular development, I've built components and implemented directives while incorporating lazy loading and dynamic loading into Angular routers. Leveraging Angular Http services, I've conducted asynchronous evaluations of form input fields against database data. Additionally, I possess expertise in Java 1.8, particularly in utilizing the Stream API for bulk data operations and API enhancements. With experience in Python frameworks like Django and Flask, I've developed REST-based web services using Node.js and Express.js to provide JSON data to applications. My skill set extends to designing multi-tier distributed Enterprise Applications using MVC, Singleton, and other design patterns, releasing Spring Boot frameworks with Hibernate interceptors, creating REST APIs with Spring MVC, and utilizing Hibernate for object-relational mapping. Furthermore, I've worked with MongoDB for NoSQL data storage, implemented messaging queues with RabbitMQ, created AWS CloudFormation templates for deployment, and used Maven for build automation, integrating it with Eclipse for local builds.

            <p> 
            Engaged in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) following the Waterfall methodology, I developed a web-based application using HTML, JSP, Spring MVC, and Hibernate frameworks, while also designing the user interface with JSP, HTML5, CSS3, Ajax toolkit, and JavaScript. Marshalling and UN marshalling of XML to HTML and vice versa were implemented, alongside extensive coding in Java, including key concepts such as Collections, Exception Handling, Java I/O, and Generics for business logic. Core Java and J2EE technologies were leveraged for application development, particularly utilizing Spring framework capabilities such as Dependency Injection, Security, and Web Flow with Spring MVC. Additionally, SOAP UI was employed to evaluate SOAP services and REST APIs in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based application. The environment included HTML, XML, JavaScript, Ajax, JSP, CSS3, Core Java, J2EE, Spring MVC, SQL, SOAP UI, and REST API, managed through SVN version control.
